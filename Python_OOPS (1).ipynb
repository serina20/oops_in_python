        "\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a widely used programming paradigm that structures software around objects rather than functions and logic. The core idea is to model real-world entities or concepts as \"objects\" in your code.\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "- In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is the fundamental building block. It's essentially a blueprint, template, or a master plan for creating objects.\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "- An object is an instance of a class. An object is something that comprises of two main parts:\n",
        "-> Data: the actual data (attributes/ features) of the class.\n",
        "-> Methods: the function that operates on the data.\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "-> Abstraction and Encapsulation are two fundamental concepts in Object-Oriented Programming. They both involve \"hiding\" details. However, they serve distinct purposes and operate at different levels.\n",
        "- Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential features. Focuses on \"what\" an object does. Eg. driving a car without knowing the internal working of one.\n",
        "- Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods together within a class and controlling access to that data. Eg. Making a car's engine details private, accessible only by professionals.\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "-> In Python, dunder methods (short for \"double underscore methods\") are special methods that have names starting and ending with two underscores. Eg. `__init__` or `__add__`.\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "-> Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming that allows a new class (called the subclass, derived class, or child class) to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from an existing class (called the superclass, base class, or parent class). Its primary benefits are:\n",
        "- Code resuability.\n",
        "- Extensivity.\n",
        "- Code management and maintainability.\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "-> Polymorphism ('poly' - many & 'morph' - form) in Object Oriented Progarmming is the ability of an object to take on many forms, or more precisely, the ability to process objects of different types through a single, common interface. It allows you to define a common interface (eg. a method name) in a base class, and then derived classes can implement that method in a differnt specified way(s).\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "-> In Python, encapsulation is achieved more through conventions and programming practices rather than strict, enforced access modifiers like in languages such as Java or C++.\n",
        "Encapsulation in Python is achieved  by:\n",
        "- Classes: Bundle data (attributes) and functions (methods) into a single unit.\n",
        "- Single Underscore: Prefixing attributes/methods with '_' indicates they are 'protected' but access isn't strictly enforced.\n",
        "- Double Underscore: Prefixing with '__' changes the name internally, making direct external access harder. Primarily for preventing name clashes in inheritance.\n",
        "- @property Decorator: The way to create controlled \"getters\" and \"setters\" for attributes, allowing validation and computed values while maintaining a simple access syntax.\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "- In Python the term 'constructor' is commonly used for `__init__` method. The `__init__` method is a special method in Python used to initiallize the attribute of a newly created object (instance) of a class. It gets called automatically when a new object has been created in a class.\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "-> Class Methods:\n",
        "- Decorator: Defined using the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "- First Argument: Automatically receives the class itself as its first argument, conventionally named cls.\n",
        "- Purpose: Alternative Constructors, common for creating objects in different ways.\n",
        "Staic methods:\n",
        "- Decorator: Defined using the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "- No Special Arguments: Does not receive self (instance) or cls (class) as its first argument. It's just like a regular function defined inside a class.\n",
        "- Purpose: Used for utility functions that logically belong to the class but don't need to access or modify any class or instance specific data.\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "-> In Python, true method overloading (multiple methods with the same name, different parameters) isn't supported; the last definition always overrides previous ones. Instead, you achieve similar flexibility in a single method using default arguments, args / kwargs, or type checking (isinstance()) for varied inputs. This is known as Method overloading.\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "-> Method overriding in Object-Oriented Programming is a powerful feature that allows a subclass (or child class) to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass (or parent class). This concept is fundamental to achieving runtime polymorphism, enabling different types of objects to respond to the same method call in their own unique ways, making code more flexible, extensible, and adaptable to specialized behaviors without altering the base class.\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "-> The @property decorator in Python is a built-in decorator that allows you to treat a method as an attribute. Its primary purpose is to provide a \"Pythonic\" way to implement controlled access (getters, setters, and deleters) for class attributes, thereby enhancing encapsulation and data integrity without breaking the external interface of your class.\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "-> Polymorphism is incredibly important in OOP because it brings about flexibility, extensibility, and reusability in code. It allows you to write generic code that can operate on objects of different types, provided they share a common interface.\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "-> In Python, an abstract class serves as a blueprint for other classes. It cannot be instantiated directly, meaning you cannot create objects from it. Instead, its primary purpose is to define a common interface and potentially some shared behavior that its subclasses must implement.\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "- Some of the advantages of OOP are:\n",
        "-> Modularity: OOP encourages breaking down a large, complex problem into smaller, manageable, and self-contained units (objects) where each object is responsible for a specific part of the system. This modularity leads to highly organized code, making it easier to understand, navigate, and debug the code.\n",
        "-> Reusablity: One of the most powerful feature of OOP is inheritance where common functionalities can be defined in a parent class and then inherited by multiple child classes.\n",
        "-> Extensibility: OOP makes it easier to extend functionality without modifying existing code. You can add new features by creating new classes that inherit from existing ones, or by composing new objects from existing ones.\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "-> Class Variable:\n",
        "- Definition: Defined directly within the class body, outside of any methods.\n",
        "- Ownership: Owned by the class itself.\n",
        "- Sharing: Shared by all instances (objects) of that class. If you change a class variable using the class name, the change is reflected in all existing and future instances.\n",
        "-> Instance Variable:\n",
        "- Definition: Defined inside a method (typically the `__init__` constructor) and associated with self.\n",
        "- Ownership: Owned by individual instances (objects) of the class.\n",
        "- Sharing: Each instance has its own unique copy of the instance variables. Changes to an instance variable in one object do not affect the same variable in other objects.\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "-> Multiple inheritance in Python is an OOP feature that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. This means a single child class can combine the functionalities of several distinct base classes.\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of `__str__` and `__repr__` methods in Python.\n",
        "-> `__str__` (for \"string\"):\n",
        "- Purpose: To provide an informal, human-readable string representation of an object. This is what you'd typically want to show to an end-user.\n",
        "- Called by: The built-in print() function & The built-in str() constructor.\n",
        "- Output: Should be concise, easy to understand, and provide a user-friendly overview of the object's state.\n",
        "-> `__repr__` (for \"representation\"):\n",
        "- Purpose: To provide an official, unambiguous, developer-focused string representation of an object. This is primarily for debugging, logging, and inspection.\n",
        "- Called by: The built-in repr() function.\n",
        "- Output: Ideally, the string returned by `__repr__` should be a valid Python expression that, when evaluated (eval()), could recreate an object with the same value (if possible). If not, it should be an informative string, typically including the class name and essential attributes. It prioritizes clarity for the developer over aesthetics for the user.\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
        "- The super() function in Python is a significant tool in OOP, especially when dealing with inheritance. Its primary purpose is to provide a way to call methods from a parent (superclass) or sibling class in the Method Resolution Order (MRO), allowing for proper collaboration and extension of functionality within an inheritance hierarchy.\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the `__del__`method in Python?\n",
        "-> The `__del__` method in Python is known as the destructor method. Its significance lies in its role during an object's cleanup phase before it's removed from memory by Python's garbage collector.\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "-> @staticmethod:\n",
        "- No Implicit First Argument: It does not automatically receive the instance (self) or the class (cls) as its first argument.\n",
        "- Purpose: Behaves like a regular function defined inside a class. It belongs to the class's namespace but doesn't interact with the class's state or any instance's state.\n",
        "- Use Case: Utility functions that logically belong to the class but don't need access to instance-specific data or class-specific data.\n",
        "- Independent: Can be called on the class or an instance, but its behavior is always the same as it doesn't depend on the object or class it's called from.\n",
        "-> @classmethod\n",
        "- Implicit First Argument (cls): It automatically receives the class itself as its first argument, conventionally named cls.\n",
        "- Purpose: Operates on the class itself rather than an instance. It can access and modify class-level attributes.\n",
        "Use Case: Alternative Constructors: Common for creating new instances of the class (or its subclasses) in different ways. For example, ClassName.from_string(\"data\").\n",
        "- Bound to the Class: It's bound to the class and understands the class's structure, even if called on an instance.\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "-> Polymorphism with inheritance in Python enables you to design a flexible system where you interact with objects based on what they can do (their common methods), rather than what they specifically are. This allows you to add new, specialized types to your system without changing the code that processes them, leading to highly extensible, reusable, and maintainable applications.\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "-> Method chaining in Python OOP is a programming technique where you call multiple methods on the same object in a single, continuous line of code. This creates a \"chain\" of operations, with each method in the chain typically returning the object itself (or a new, modified object that can also be chained), allowing the next method call to operate on the result of the previous one.\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the `__call__` method in Python?\n",
        "-> The `__call__` method in Python is a special dunder method that allows an instance of a class to be called like a function. If a class implements this method, then objects created from that class become \"callable\" objects.\n",
